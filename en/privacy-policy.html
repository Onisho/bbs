<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Everyone has the right to protection to his/her personal data. BBS respects its users' right to be informed regarding the collection of and other operations involving their personal data. In using data, that may directly or indirectly identify you personally, we will apply the principle of strict necessity. For this reason, we have designed BBS in such a way that the use of personal data will be kept to a minimum and will not exceed the purposes for which your personal data was collected and/or processed; we do not process your personal data when we can provide you with services through the use of anonymous data (such as marketing research made for improving our services) or by other means which allow BBS to identify you a part from when it is strictly necessary or upon request of the competent public authorities or the police (as, for example, in case of traffic data or your IP address). BBS deterimes the purposes and means of processing your personal data, including security measures, as BBS controls BBS users' personal data. We want our users to always be aware of any information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. BBS makes every effort to treat your personal information with care. Most of the pages on our site can be accessed without having to fill in your personal details. But for some parts we do need information. This statement explains how BBS treats this information and what it is used for.</p>
